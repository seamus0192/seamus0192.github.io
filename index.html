      <p id = 'about-txt'>I am a Computer Science Student from Cal Poly (SLO). <br><br><br>
        First and foremost, I am a learner. No matter what the situation, my ability to learn and solve problems
        presented to me is what I believe makes me stand out. When given a task, I solve it. I go above and beyond
        and create results that exceed expectations and when given a chance at work, I quickly prove this. <br> <br>
        My experience in Computer Science spans throughout the field, and I am ready to take it to the next level
        with real work experience. My experience comes in the form of projects, some of which includes my work
        on a fully functional game built in java, multiple algorithmic based projects in python, and web
        development. I have a very strong foundational knowledge of key topics such as data structures,
        object-oriented programing, and object-c/assembly. I feel the most comfortable with Java and Python,
        but because of my fundamental knowledge of computer science, I believe that I can work in any development
        language, given a small amount of time to get used to syntax. <br><br>
        On top of that, by the end of this year, I plan on taking classes on system programming,
        discrete structures, and data science. I am passionate and motivated to become the best
        software engineer I can, and all I need is an opportunity to prove my talents. I am the
        team member to work towards exceptionalism, not just someone who is fine with the statis quo. <br><br>
        On a more personal level, some of the stuff I am super passionate about includes travel, music, sports, 
        and connecting with people. I like to find the beauty in things and think that humor and loyalty are
        some of my greatest strengths. I also really believe in the principle of balance, something that is
        everchanging and which we should always be aware about.
        Check out my computer science <a href = "school.html">education</a> and <a href = "work.html">projects</a> here or at the top of the page, but I 
        also coded together a couple simple javascript/ html programs to show off some of the stuff I love on this main page. 
        Thank you for visiting my website!
